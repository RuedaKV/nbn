            <h3 class="article-byline">BY <a class="byline-link" href="https://northbynorthwestern.com/author/ali/" target="_blank">ALI BIANCO</a></h3>
        </header>

        <article class="article-body">
            <p class="drop-cap">Kaniya Hester, Chloe Fisher, Eric Loza-Corona and Mia Castle live separate lives at Northwestern.</p>
            <p>Hester is a Communication third-year trying to demystify the business world, who changed career paths in the middle of the pandemic. Fisher, a Weinberg second-year, is a physics student from Michigan who wears a Canada Goose coat and loafers in the winter. Loza-Corona, a McCormick second-year who stayed at home for the pandemic, is a Los Angeles native who is only now meeting his Zoom friends in person. And Castle, a Weinberg second-year studying math, started at Northwestern as pre-med and now spends her free time in the Henry Crown Sports Pavilion for swim club.
            </p>

            <p>They have had all diverging NU experiences. But they do have two things in common.
            </p>

            <p>
                None of them had parents who went to college. And by going to Northwestern, they are also part of the 23% of first-generation students in the US who attend a highly selective institution.
            </p>

            <p>The term first-generation applies to students “where neither parent has obtained a college degree,” according to Northwestern’s Student Enrichment Services (SES). SES organizes campus programming and resources for first-generation, low-income and/or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) students.
            </p>

            <p>According to statistics from the Pew Research Center, only 26% of adults in the U.S. with non-college-educated parents have obtained a bachelor’s degree. This number drops to 21% and 15% for Black and Hispanic populations, respectively, and the first-generation student dropout rate is four times higher than that of students whose parents have degrees.
            </p>

            <p>The Center for First-Generation Student Success says, “The term "first-generation" implies the possibility that a student may lack the critical cultural capital necessary for college success because their parents did not attend college.”
            </p>

            <p>Hester, Fisher, Loza-Corona and Castle all fit this simple definition, but being first-generation means more than wearing the label — it creates communities that combat stigmas. And, sometimes, being a first-generation student means using these statistics as fuel to succeed.
