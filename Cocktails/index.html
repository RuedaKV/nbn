            <p class="drop-cap">  In an era of being sad and lonely in our dorms and apartments, we NERDwestern students might find ourselves needing a special NorthWASTED pick-me-up to take the edge off. Fear not, dear reader, for we mixologists at NBN have compiled a recipe book of the perfect cocktails for each Northwestern school.

                <p>For a school with as many majors as Weinberg, it’s only fitting that we choose a drink that encompasses many tastes. Weinberg students, we recommend that you kick back with something simple yet satisfying, like a beer or seltzer.
                </p>

                <p>A beer? That’s it? We’re more interesting than that.
                </p>

                <p>Okay, okay, we get it, you like to party. Introducing the Weinberger Bomb! Grab your favorite beer or seltzer of choice, accompanied by a shot glass of either whiskey, rum or vodka. Pour the canned beverage into a glass, then get ready to drop your “bomb” of hard liquor in (just like how you dropped that fourth class in the second week of Spring Quarter — kaboom!).

                <p>For all the thespians, dramatics and Hollywood hopefuls in the School of Communication, we had to create something with enough star power to really blow you away (and with enough kick to ease that awkward sexual tension within your acappella group). Introducing the School of Comm Cosmo. What’s better than a cosmopolitan to encapsulate the drama of Comm, served well-chilled and in a martini glass?

                <p>Ready to kick back and pretend your practice space in Ryan overlooking Lake Michigan is actually a room on a Royal Caribbean Cruise? Well, hopefully your practice room comes with a blender, because you’re going to need it for the Bienen Colada. Mixologist’s tip: Share it with your entire Latin jazz combo for that authentic feel that you’ve been trying to get for weeks.

                <p>Little is known about SESP other than, I guess, teaching?

Enjoy this drink while you turn off your Zoom camera and secretly get hammered during office hours. Woohoo!
